#Dublin Coffee Guide
##Advanced Javascript project 2

###This is a MERN stack application, which was an ongoing project as part of a 4th year advanced javascript module on the Creative Computing course @ IADT. 
The aim of this project was to develop a full stack application using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js (MERN). This project also uses Bootstrap for styling, implements redux for state management and uses authentication to restrict access to certain parts of the site depending on the type of user. The purpose of the app is to allow users to find information about independent coffee shops in Dublin. For a coffee shop owner it allows them to register and then input information such as the coffee shop name, location, opening hours, website and contact information. They can edit or delete their coffee shop details and account at any time afterwards. For a user who just wants to find out information about a coffee shop, they donâ€™t need an account,  they can just view all the information regardless.
